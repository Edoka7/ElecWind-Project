## Why I do that?
The assumption of the project was to use many skills in one place, so as to break out of the tutorial monotony and do each solution separately.

As expected, there are problems with a larger project that cannot be learned in tutorials. I was very happy to solve them and planned everything to harmonize with each other.

This is also my first work with a GIT solution and my first GITHUB repository. Of course, man learns best by practice.
